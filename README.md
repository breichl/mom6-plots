# mom6-plots
Centralized plotting styles and functions for MOM6 output

Many folks in the m2lines project are working with MOM6 ocean model output and might want to produce 'standardized' plots to evaluate e.g. the performance of different parametrizations against each other. 

This repository aims to provide 2 things:

- Consistent [Matplotlib Style Sheets](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#customizing-with-style-sheets), so that plots from different researchers can be combined in publications/presentations
- Common methods to compute reusable metrics (e.g. SST bias, OHC, ...) and plot them in a constistent way.
